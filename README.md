# Ontario-Public-Library
## 1. Background
In the digital age, people can access a wide range of information from their computer. As a result, the existence of public library is being questioning by many library skeptics: does the public library still matter? These circumstance leads to a strategic question for Ontario libraries: How can Ontario libraries be successful in the 21st century?

## 2. Objectives
This analysis will analyze the performance of top tier libraries by revenue. To ensure an “apples to apples” comparison, the revenue mentioned in this analysis focus on ‘Operating Revenue per active cardholder for each library’. The analysis’s objectives are:
- To review performance of top tier libraries by revenue in Ontario
- To identify opportunities to promote a sustainable growth among top tier libraries
## 3. Data Overview
Record of 309 libraries in Ontario from 2015- 2018
Data to be used in this analysis:
- Unique Identified information of each library: Library.Number
- Year of collecting data: Survey.Year.From
- Number of active cardholders: A1.14..No..of.Active.Library.Cardholders
- Operating Revenues: B2.9..Total.Operating.Revenues
- Number of residents served: P1.1..Resident.Population.Served:
- Number of programs held: ‘F2.1.P..No..of.programs.held.annually’... 
- Number of total attendance for each program: ‘F2.2.A..Annual.program.attendance’....
## 5.Summary & Recommendation
#### Summary
- In 2018, majority of top tier libraries by revenue belonged to bottom tiers by number active cardholders. In fact, 2 out of 3 top tier libraries by revenue (~64%) belonged to bottom tiers by number of active cardholders, which indicates that the main revenue source of these top tiers libraries was from only a small group of active cardholders with heavy service usage (heavy users). Because the top tier libraries’ revenue highly depended on a small group of heavy users, maintaining users’ loyalty was vital for their survival.
- While top tier libraries maintained good revenue growth rate, majority of them were suffered from a decrease in number of cardholders from 2015 to 2018. In particular, 68% top tier libraries by revenue experienced a decrease or significant decrease in number of cardholders from 2015 to 2018. Because the top tier libraries’ revenue was generated from a small group of heavy users, a drop in number of active cardholders would cause these libraries to be more susceptible revenue stagnation or revenue loss in the long-term.
#### Recommendations
- To promote a sustainable growth and maintain loyalty among heavy usage cardholders, top tier libraries should further investigate key reasons of a decline in number of active cardholders. Further data collection will be needed to understand key drivers of loyalty, service preferences among heavy usage cardholders for each library.
- To promote revenue growth and lessen the revenue dependency on heavy users, top tier libraries should recruit more active cardholders by promoting referrals among current heavy usage cardholders, and prioritize resource on favorable programs by local residents (“Homework help”, “Early literacy and Early learning”, “Teen programming”, “Culture Days poetry and story readings art shows”)
